[DirectStorage API](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-is-coming-to-pc/) is an API in the DirectX family originally designed for the [Velocity Architecture](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/07/14/a-closer-look-at-xbox-velocity-architecture/) to Windows. The DirectX API is architected in a way that takes all this into account and maximizes performance throughout the entire pipeline from NVMe drive all the way to the GPU. It does this in several ways: by reducing per-request NVMe overhead, enabling batched many-at-a-time parallel IO requests which can be efficiently fed to the GPU, and giving games better control over when they get notified of IO request completion instead of having to react to every tiny IO completion. The DirectStorage API will be available on [Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11) PCs with NVMe SSDs, but will also be support in [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10) version 1909 and newer.

[ARM64EC (“Emulation Compatible”)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/arm64ec) is an application binary interface (ABI) for Windows 11 on ARM that runs with native speed and is interoperable with x64 architecture. An app, process, or even a module can freely mix and match with ARM64EC and x64 as needed. The ARM64EC code in the app will run natively while any x64 code will run using Windows 11 on ARM’s built-in emulation. The ARM64EC ABI differs slightly from the current [ARM64 ABI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/arm64-windows-abi-conventions?view=msvc-160) in ways that make it binary compatible with x64 code. Specifically, the ARM64EC ABI follows x64 software conventions including calling convention, stack usage, and data alignment, making ARM64EC and x64 interoperable. Apps built as ARM64EC may contain x64 code but do not have to, since ARM64EC is its own complete, first-class ABI for Windows.
 
 
**NOTE:** Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chip will be available in mobile devices starting Mid-2024.

[Snapdragon X Elite](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2023/10/qualcomm-unleashes-snapdragon-x-elite--the-ai-super-charged-plat) is its all-new custom CPU architecture, codenamed Oryon. The X Elite includes a total of **12 Oryon cores**, rather than a mix of large and small cores like Qualcomm has used in past designs. When all cores are active, they can run at peak speeds of up to **3.8 GHz**, though when just one or two cores are boosting they can go up to **4.3 GHz**.
 
 * Qualcomm says that the X Elite's Adreno GPU has upgradeable drivers, which means new capabilities can be added over time. it will support a **4K 120 Hz laptop display**, plus a total of **three 4K external displays (or two 5K external displays)**. The GPU supports the DirectX 12 graphics API—no Vulkan support, at least not yet—and Qualcomm says it will feature **upgradeable drivers**. Qualcomm compared the X Elite's GPU performance to both [Intel's Iris Xe](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/discrete-gpus/iris-xe.html) and [AMD's Radeon 780M](https://www.amd.com/en/products/apu/amd-ryzen-7-7840u). The Adreno GPU is reportedly up to 2x as fast as the Iris Xe and up to 80% faster than the Radeon 780M, while using about one-fifth as much power.
 
 * The chip also includes respectable media encoding and decoding capabilities, with support for **hardware-accelerated H.264, H.265/HEVC, and AV1 video encoding and decoding**, plus hardware-accelerated decoding support for the **VP9 codec**.
 
 * The X Elite can use up to **64GB of LPDDR5x RAM** with up to **136 GB/s of memory bandwidth** to the chip. The image signal processor (ISP) supports up to 64 MP cameras and 4K HDR video capture. The chip supports **PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSDs and the UFS 4.0 and SD 3.0 storage standards**, as well as up to **three USB 4 ports (plus two more 10 Gbps USB 3.2 gen 2 ports)**.

  *  **[Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview)** is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems as a set of processes and services. 
 
 * **[Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365)** is a subscription that includes the most collaborative, up-to-date features in one seamless, integrated experience. It includes productivity tools such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, and more all in one place. 
 
 * **[Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/)** is a service that manages user identities and control access to your apps, data, and resources. It protects, monitors, and audits access to critical assets in your organization.
 
 * **[Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/ad-fs-overview)** allows you can employ single sign-on to external systems such as applications and websites. One typical example of the use of AD FS is Office 365. When a user signs in to Office 365, the user ID and password are redirected via the federation server to check whether the entered credentials are authentic against your On-prem AD. This is how it provides authentication to external systems through the local Active Directory.

* **[Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831593(v=ws.11))** is a service that offers directory services with the help of LDAP protocol without having to deploy any DCs. The service is used to provide directory service functionally to directory-enabled applications. 

 * **[Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/how-does-it-work)** is a service allows you to protect information within digital content. It secures the documents by defining which users can modify, open, view, print, forward, or take similar documents.

**Hierarchical Structure of Active Directory Domain Services**

 * **[Tree](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-tree-visualizations)** is formed by grouping one or more domains in a logical hierarchy. All domains within a tree are logically linked; hence they “trust” each other.
 * **[Forest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/identity/adds-forest)** is a topmost level in the Active Directory of your organization. It contains one or more trees grouped. Trees within a forest are also said to “trust” each other and share catalogs, directory schemas, domain configurations, and application data.
* **[Organizations Units (OU)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/create-ou)** are used to organize groups, users, computers, and other entities.
* **[Containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/plan/delegating-administration-of-default-containers-and-ous)**: is a tool similar to an OU; with the only difference is that you cannot link a GPO (Group Policy Object) to a generic container within AD.

### MFA

[Back to The Top](#table-of-contents)

**Multifactor Authentication (MFA)** is when you sign into your online accounts - a process we call "authentication" - you're proving to the service that you are who you say you are. Traditionally that's been done with a username and a password.

[YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/) is a security device that makes two-factor authentication as simple as possible. Instead of a code being texted to you, or generated by an app on your phone, you simply press a button on your YubiKey. Each device has a unique code built on to it, which is used to generate codes that help confirm your identity. The YubiKey USB authenticator includes NFC and has multi-protocol support including FIDO2, FIDO U2F, Yubico OTP, OATH-TOTP, OATH-HOTP, Smart card (PIV), OpenPGP, and Challenge-Response capability to give you strong hardware-based authentication.

[Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication and single sign-on (SSO) for your applications via a web portal. It acts as a companion for [reverse proxies](https://github.com/authelia/authelia#proxy-support) by allowing, denying, or redirecting requests. 

[ZITADEL](https://zitadel.com/) is an open-source authentication and authorization server providing two-factor authentication combining the best of Auth0 and Keycloak. Built for the serverless era. It includes Multi-tenancy with branding customization, secure login, self-service, OpenID Connect, OAuth2.x, SAML2, LDAP, Passwordless with FIDO2 (including Passkeys), OTP, U2F, and an unlimited audit trail is there for you, ready to use.

[Microsoft Authenticator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/download-and-install-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-351498fc-850a-45da-b7b6-27e523b8702a) is an app helps you sign in to your accounts when you're using two-step verification. Two-step verification helps you to use your accounts more securely because passwords can be forgotten, stolen, or compromised.

[Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid) is a software authenticator developed by Google that implements multi-factor authentication services using the Time-based one-time password and HMAC-based one-time password, for authenticating users of software applications.

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

### Reset your Windows 11 system

**Resetting**, is a process that reinstalls Windows 11, but lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls Windows. You can reset your PC from Settings, the sign-in screen, or by using a recovery drive or installation media.

**Reset your PC from Settings**

   1. Select Start > Settings  > System  > Recovery .
     <p align="center">
       <img src="https://github.com/mikeroyal/Asus-ROG-Ally-Guide/assets/45159366/3cf41513-3aa1-4df5-8be8-d4205c01a40b">
         <br />
      </p>

   2.  Next to **Reset this PC** , select **Reset PC**. Then, select Keep my files, choose cloud or local, change your settings, and set Restore preinstalled apps? or No. 
   
   <p align="center">
       <img src="https://github.com/mikeroyal/Asus-ROG-Ally-Guide/assets/45159366/6dc439f6-333d-41cf-8bbd-1e5cc184eb80">
         <br />
      </p>
      
   3. Click the Keep my files option.

         <br />
      </p>
      
 **Note:** You will need to do Sytem Updates when this process is finished.

### Restore from System Restore Point

This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app or driver, and when you create a restore point manually. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.

   1. In the search box on the taskbar, type control panel, and then choose it from the list of results

   2. In the Control Panel search box, type recovery.

   3. Select Recovery > Open System Restore.

   4. In the Restore system files and settings box, select Next.

   5. Select the restore point that you want to use in the list of results, and then select Scan for affected programs.

   **Notes:**

   * If you don’t see the restore point that you want to use, select the Show more restore points check box to see more restore points.

   * If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. Here’s how to check:

        * In the search box on the taskbar, type control panel, and then choose it from the list of results.

        * In the Control Panel search box, type recovery.

        *  Select **Recovery > Configure System Restore > Configure** and see if the **Turn on system protection** option is selected.

     * If the Turn on system protection option is not selected, system protection isn’t turned on and there aren't any restore points. In this scenario, you won't be able to recovery your PC using a system restore point and will need to use one of the other recovery options listed on this page.

     * If the Turn on system protection option is selected, continue with step 6.

   6. You'll see a list of items that will be deleted if you remove this restore point. If you're OK with the deletions, **select Close > Next > Finish**.

## Setting up Game Pass for Offline use

 * **Note:** Most games with a campaign mode will be playable offline, but games with network co-op or multiplayer features will not work while you’re offline. Before you go offline, connect to the Xbox network to sync your most recent game save to the cloud. While you play offline, your game save progress will continue to be saved locally, and it’ll sync the next time you sign in to Xbox. If you want to continue playing on a different device, you’ll need to go online and connect to the Xbox network to allow your local saved game to sync with the cloud again.

 * **Note 2:** PC Game Pass game licenses expire after 30 days when playing offline, and licenses for owned games expire after 14 days. To keep playing your game offline, go back online and launch the game. This renews the game’s license on your device and ensures you can go back to playing offline.  

You can only have one device as your designated offline device. **To set your device as your designated offline device:**

  * Make sure that you’re online.
  * Check that your device has the latest Windows updates: **Go to Start -> Settings -> Update & security -> Windows Update and see if any relevant updates are available**.
  * Open the Microsoft Store. You’ll be prompted to sign in if you haven’t already.
  * Select your profile icon in the upper right corner.
  * Select App settings, and then under Offline permissions, make sure that the toggle is set to On.

Once you set this, any devices previously designated as offline will be toggled to Off, and you’ll no longer be able to play games offline on those devices.

**Prepare your game or games**

Once your device is set up, you’ll need to launch each game you want to play offline while signed in to the Xbox network. You only need to do this once per game, and you’ll need to do this even if you’ve already launched the game on your device.

  * Make sure that you’re online, and that your device is set as your designated offline device. (See the steps above for details on how to do this.)
  * Launch the game you want to play offline. When prompted, sign in to Xbox.
  * Once you’ve started playing the game, you can exit at any time.

Repeat this process for each game you want to play offline. Once completed, you can go offline at any time and launch those games whenever you want to play them, without needing to sign in online each time.

### Setting up DXVK on Windows

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

</p>

### Important Note

Online multi-player games

Manipulation of Direct3D libraries in multi-player games may be considered cheating and can get your account banned. This may also apply to single-player games with an embedded or dedicated multiplayer portion. **Use at your own risk.**

#### What is DXVK?

[DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) is a set of software libraries that translates DirectX API calls to Vulkan API calls. It supports **DirectX versions 9, 10 and 11**. Vulkan and APIs similar to it **(DirectX12, Metal)** are a a lot better at making use of multi-core/multi-threaded CPUs to batch up work that needs to be done by the GPU thereby making better use of both CPU and GPU. This can lead to significant performance boosts in some games.

**First, do these steps:**

  * 1. Download the [latest release of DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk/releases) from GitHub.

  * 2. Use 7-Zip to unzip the ```dxvk-x.x.x folder``` (where ```x.x.x``` is the version number).
  
 **Do these steps for each game:**

**Important information you need to know about the game you want use DXVK with:**

   * The version of DirectX it uses.

   * Whether it's using 32-bit or 64-bit.

In most cases, you can find out both of these from a game's API section section on [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home). There may be some clues in the file/folder names your game's folder about it being 32-bit or 64-bit. If there's a ```steam_api64.dll``` there then it's probably **64-bit** or if there's a ```binkw32.dll``` it's likely to be **32-bit**.

 * Open the folder where your game's executable is (.exe file).

 * Open the folder where you extracted DXVK and go the appropriate folder for your game's bitness, x32 for 32-bit, x64 for 64-bit.

 * Copy the following files to the folder where the game's executable is depending on the game's DirectX version:

|DirectX version | Files to copy|
|------------|-----------|
|9	| d3d9.dll|
|10	| d3d10.dll, d3d10_1.dll, d3d10core.dll, d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll|
|11	| d3d11.dll and dxgi.dll|

**If your game supports multiple DirectX versions copy all the applicable DLLs.**

**That's it!** Now run the game.

**Unfortunately, DXVK isn't going to work in all situations. So far I've been unsuccessful in getting it to work in the following scenarios:**

   * Xbox Game Pass (and likely Microsoft Store) games.
   * Steam In-Home Streaming with exclusive fullscreen games.

## Improving Game Performance & Load Times

### DirectStorage

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

[DirectStorage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/gdk/_content/gc/system/overviews/directstorage/directstorage-overview) is a feature intended to allow games to make full use of high-speed storage (such as NVMe SSDs) that can can deliver multiple gigabytes a second of small (eg 64kb) data reads with minimal CPU overhead. Although it is possible to saturate a drive using traditional ReadFile-based IO the CPU overhead of increases non-linearly as the size of individual reads decreases. Additionally, most games choose to store their assets compressed on disk in order to reduce the install footprint, with these assets being decompressed on the fly as load time. The CPU overhead of this becomes increasingly expensive as bandwidth increases.

 * [Microsoft DirectStorage GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectStorage)
 * [DirectStorage on Windows Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectStorage/blob/main/README.md)
 * [DirectStorage API Downloads](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-api-downloads/)
 
 New features for DirectStorage 1.1:
 
 * GPU decompression and GDeflate now available.
 * Added EnqueueSetEvent to use Win32 event objects for completion notification.
 * [Performance improvements and bug fixes.](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/directstorage-api-downloads/)
    
**GPU decompression** is supported on all DirectX 12 + Shader Model 6.0 GPUs. However, one of the benefits of DirectStorage 1.1 is that GPU hardware vendors can provide additional optimizations for their hardware, called metacommands.

This article explains how to set up WSA in Windows 11 to Run Android Apps. WSA runs as a virtual machine using [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/) and is based on [AOSP](https://source.android.com/) version 11. 

As of now, WSA has some specific requirements. With time, some pre-requisites like Region would be eased. See the following requirements below:

   - Your Device must be running Build 22000 or later meeting the requirements for Windows 11, including supported processors.

   - The Computer must support virtualization and be enabled in BIOS/UEFI and Optional Features.

   - The device must have at least 8GB of RAM and SSD as a Storage device. For WSA, a Hard drive is not supported.

   - The Store version must be 22110.1402.6.0 or higher. Go to Store Library to update.

   - The PC's Region and Amazon account you plan to use must be US-based.

   - Your PC must be in Windows Insider Program Beta Channel.

### Getting started with Windows Subsystem for Android

[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide#table-of-contents)

   - Open the Amazon App store from this [link](http://aka.ms/AmazonAppstore).

   - Click Install. It would download Amazon AppStore and Windows subsystem for Android.

   - When done, you would see the Windows subsystem for Android on your app list, together with Amazon AppStore.

  -  Open the Amazon AppStore, and sign in with your US-based Amazon Account on the screen that shows.

   - Locate your App in the catalogue and click Install.

### Windows Subsystem for Android Settings

[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Windows-11-Guide#table-of-contents)

There are also a bunch of Android Settings you can customize as well, which are as under.

 - Files show the files which Apps download to the Device.

 - Subsystem Screen reader helps accessibility wise, like screen reading on in Android apps you plan to run.

 - Developer mode helps you to sideload an APK file manually using ADB.Checkout this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_LxsWa7JIg).
 
 - If the Subsystem is selected As needed, no resources are used in the Background, so as a result, apps open slowly. If a continuous option is selected, resources continue to be used in the Background, and Apps open quickly.

[Windows UI Library (WinUI) 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui2/) is tightly integrated with [Windows 10 and later SDKs](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/) and provides official native Windows UI controls and other user interface elements for UWP applications (and desktop applications using [XAML Islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/xaml-islands)).

[XAML Islands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/xaml-islands)) is a feature that enables you to enhance the look, feel, and functionality of your existing WPF, Windows Forms, and C++ desktop (Win32) applications with the latest Windows 10 UI features that are only available via WinRT XAML controls. This means that you can use UWP features such as [Windows Ink](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/pen-and-stylus-interactions) and controls that support the [Fluent Design System](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/fluent-design-system/index) in your existing WPF, Windows Forms, and C++ desktop applications.

[Windows Community Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/) is a collection of helper functions, custom controls, and app services. It simplifies and demonstrates common developer tasks building UWP apps for Windows 10. The toolkit can be used to build apps for any Windows 10 device, including PC, Mobile, Xbox, IoT and HoloLens. You can also use the toolkit with an existing desktop app converted to UWP using the Desktop Bridge.

[Windows Pseudo Console (ConPTY)](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/windows-command-line-introducing-the-windows-pseudo-console-conpty/) is an API that provides a mechanism that is similar to the POSIX PTY model, but in a Windows-relevant manner VT Interactivity. Where it receives incoming UTF-8 encoded text, converts each displayable text character into the corresponding INPUT_RECORD, and stores them in the Input Buffer.

## C/C++ Learning Resources

[C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) is a cross-platform language that can be used to build high-performance applications developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

[C](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html) is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. It supports structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. C also provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, which makes it one was of the most widely used programming languages today.

[Embedded C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_C) is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the [C Standards Committee](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee) to address issues that exist between C extensions for different [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system). The extensions hep enhance microprocessor features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations. This makes Embedded C the most popular embedded software language in the world.

  ## Tools & Networking Concepts

    • Connection: In networking, a connection refers to pieces of related information that are transferred through a network. This generally infers that a connection is built before the data transfer (by following the procedures laid out in a protocol) and then is deconstructed at the at the end of the data transfer.

    • Packet: A packet is, generally speaking, the most basic unit that is transferred over a network. When communicating over a network, packets are the envelopes that carry your data (in pieces) from one end point to the other.

Packets have a header portion that contains information about the packet including the source and destination, timestamps, network hops. The main portion of a packet contains the actual data being transferred. It is sometimes called the body or the payload.

    • Network Interface: A network interface can refer to any kind of software interface to networking hardware. For instance, if you have two network cards in your computer, you can control and configure each network interface associated with them individually.

A network interface may be associated with a physical device, or it may be a representation of a virtual interface. The "loop-back" device, which is a virtual interface to the local machine, is an example of this.

    • LAN: LAN stands for "local area network". It refers to a network or a portion of a network that is not publicly accessible to the greater internet. A home or office network is an example of a LAN.

    • WAN: WAN stands for "wide area network". It means a network that is much more extensive than a LAN. While WAN is the relevant term to use to describe large, dispersed networks in general, it is usually meant to mean the internet, as a whole.
If an interface is connected to the WAN, it is generally assumed that it is reachable through the internet.

    • Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules and standards that basically define a language that devices can use to communicate. There are a great number of protocols in use extensively in networking, and they are often implemented in different layers.

Some low level protocols are TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP. Some familiar examples of application layer protocols, built on these lower protocols, are HTTP (for accessing web content), SSH, TLS/SSL, and FTP.

    • Port: A port is an address on a single machine that can be tied to a specific piece of software. It is not a physical interface or location, but it allows your server to be able to communicate using more than one application.

    • Firewall: A firewall is a program that decides whether traffic coming into a server or going out should be allowed. A firewall usually works by creating rules for which type of traffic is acceptable on which ports. Generally, firewalls block ports that are not used by a specific application on a server.

    • NAT: Network address translation is a way to translate requests that are incoming into a routing server to the relevant devices or servers that it knows about in the LAN. This is usually implemented in physical LANs as a way to route requests through one IP address to the necessary backend servers.

    • VPN: Virtual private network is a means of connecting separate LANs through the internet, while maintaining privacy. This is used as a means of connecting remote systems as if they were on a local network, often for security reasons.

## Network Layers

	While networking is often discussed in terms of topology in a horizontal way, between hosts, its implementation is layered in a vertical fashion throughout a computer or network. This means is that there are multiple technologies and protocols that are built on top of each other in order for communication to function more easily. Each successive, higher layer abstracts the raw data a little bit more, and makes it simpler to use for applications and users. It also allows you to leverage lower layers in new ways without having to invest the time and energy to develop the protocols and applications that handle those types of traffic.

	As data is sent out of one machine, it begins at the top of the stack and filters downwards. At the lowest level, actual transmission to another machine takes place. At this point, the data travels back up through the layers of the other computer. Each layer has the ability to add its own "wrapper" around the data that it receives from the adjacent layer, which will help the layers that come after decide what to do with the data when it is passed off.

	One method of talking about the different layers of network communication is the OSI model. OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnect.This model defines seven separate layers. The layers in this model are:

    • Application: The application layer is the layer that the users and user-applications most often interact with. Network communication is discussed in terms of availability of resources, partners to communicate with, and data synchronization.

    • Presentation: The presentation layer is responsible for mapping resources and creating context. It is used to translate lower level networking data into data that applications expect to see.

    • Session: The session layer is a connection handler. It creates, maintains, and destroys connections between nodes in a persistent way.

    • Transport: The transport layer is responsible for handing the layers above it a reliable connection. In this context, reliable refers to the ability to verify that a piece of data was received intact at the other end of the connection. This layer can resend information that has been dropped or corrupted and can acknowledge the receipt of data to remote computers.

    • Network: The network layer is used to route data between different nodes on the network. It uses addresses to be able to tell which computer to send information to. This layer can also break apart larger messages into smaller chunks to be reassembled on the opposite end.

    • Data Link: This layer is implemented as a method of establishing and maintaining reliable links between different nodes or devices on a network using existing physical connections.

    • Physical: The physical layer is responsible for handling the actual physical devices that are used to make a connection. This layer involves the bare software that manages physical connections as well as the hardware itself (like Ethernet).

The TCP/IP model, more commonly known as the Internet protocol suite, is another layering model that is simpler and has been widely adopted.It defines the four separate layers, some of which overlap with the OSI model:

    • Application: In this model, the application layer is responsible for creating and transmitting user data between applications. The applications can be on remote systems, and should appear to operate as if locally to the end user.
The communication takes place between peers network.

    • Transport: The transport layer is responsible for communication between processes. This level of networking utilizes ports to address different services. It can build up unreliable or reliable connections depending on the type of protocol used.

    • Internet: The internet layer is used to transport data from node to node in a network. This layer is aware of the endpoints of the connections, but does not worry about the actual connection needed to get from one place to another. IP addresses are defined in this layer as a way of reaching remote systems in an addressable manner.

    • Link: The link layer implements the actual topology of the local network that allows the internet layer to present an addressable interface. It establishes connections between neighboring nodes to send data.

## Interfaces
Interfaces are networking communication points for your computer. Each interface is associated with a physical or virtual networking device. Typically, your server will have one configurable network interface for each Ethernet or wireless internet card you have. In addition, it will define a virtual network interface called the "loopback" or localhost interface. This is used as an interface to connect applications and processes on a single computer to other applications and processes. You can see this referenced as the "lo" interface in many tools.

## Protocols
Networking works by piggybacks on a number of different protocols on top of each other. In this way, one piece of data can be transmitted using multiple protocols encapsulated within one another.

Media access control is a communications protocol that is used to distinguish specific devices. Each device is supposed to get a unique MAC address during the manufacturing process that differentiates it from every other device on the internet. Addressing hardware by the MAC address allows you to reference a device by a unique value even when the software on top may change the name for that specific device during operation. Media access control is one of the only protocols from the link layer that you are likely to interact with on a regular basis.

The IP protocol is one of the fundamental protocols that allow the internet to work. IP addresses are unique on each network and they allow machines to address each other across a network. It is implemented on the internet layer in the IP/TCP model. Networks can be linked together, but traffic must be routed when crossing network boundaries. This protocol assumes an unreliable network and multiple paths to the same destination that it can dynamically change between. There are a number of different implementations of the protocol. The most common implementation today is IPv4, although IPv6 is growing in popularity as an alternative due to the scarcity of IPv4 addresses available and improvements in the protocols capabilities.

ICMP: internet control message protocol is used to send messages between devices to indicate the availability or error conditions. These packets are used in a variety of network diagnostic tools, such as ping and traceroute. Usually ICMP packets are transmitted when a packet of a different kind meets some kind of a problem. Basically, they are used as a feedback mechanism for network communications.

TCP: Transmission control protocol is implemented in the transport layer of the IP/TCP model and is used to establish reliable connections. TCP is one of the protocols that encapsulates data into packets. It then transfers these to the remote end of the connection using the methods available on the lower layers. On the other end, it can check for errors, request certain pieces to be resent, and reassemble the information into one logical piece to send to the application layer. The protocol builds up a connection prior to data transfer using a system called a three-way handshake. This is a way for the two ends of the communication to acknowledge the request and agree upon a method of ensuring data reliability. After the data has been sent, the connection is torn down using a similar four-way handshake. TCP is the protocol of choice for many of the most popular uses for the internet, including WWW, FTP, SSH, and email. It is safe to say that the internet we know today would not be here without TCP.

UDP: User datagram protocol is a popular companion protocol to TCP and is also implemented in the transport layer. The fundamental difference between UDP and TCP is that UDP offers unreliable data transfer. It does not verify that data has been received on the other end of the connection. This might sound like a bad thing, and for many purposes, it is. However, it is also extremely important for some functions. It’s not required to wait for confirmation that the data was received and forced to resend data, UDP is much faster than TCP. It does not establish a connection with the remote host, it simply fires off the data to that host and doesn't care if it is accepted or not. Since UDP is a simple transaction, it is useful for simple communications like querying for network resources. It also doesn't maintain a state, which makes it great for transmitting data from one machine to many real-time clients. This makes it ideal for VOIP, games, and other applications that cannot afford delays.

HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol is a protocol defined in the application layer that forms the basis for communication on the web. HTTP defines a number of functions that tell the remote system what you are requesting. For instance, GET, POST, and DELETE all interact with the requested data in a different way.

[JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io) is a compact URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS).

[OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) is an open source authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service, such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter GitHub, and DigitalOcean. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account, and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.

FTP: File transfer protocol is in the application layer and provides a way of transferring complete files from one host to another. It is inherently insecure, so it is not recommended for any externally facing network unless it is implemented as a public, download-only resource.

DNS: Domain name system is an application layer protocol used to provide a human-friendly naming mechanism for internet resources. It is what ties a domain name to an IP address and allows you to access sites by name in your browser.

SSH: Secure shell is an encrypted protocol implemented in the application layer that can be used to communicate with a remote server in a secure way. Many additional technologies are built around this protocol because of its end-to-end encryption and ubiquity. There are many other protocols that we haven't covered that are equally important. However, this should give you a good overview of some of the fundamental technologies that make the internet and networking possible.

## Virtualization

[KVM (for Kernel-based Virtual Machine)](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) is a full virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware containing virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V). It consists of a loadable kernel module, kvm.ko, that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and a processor specific module, kvm-intel.ko or kvm-amd.ko.

[QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) is a fast processor emulator using a portable dynamic translator. QEMU emulates a full system, including a processor and various peripherals. It can be used to launch a different Operating System without rebooting the PC or to debug system code.

[Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/) enables running virtualized computer systems on top of a physical host. These virtualized systems can be used and managed just as if they were physical computer systems, however they exist in virtualized and isolated environment. Special software called a hypervisor manages access between the virtual systems and the physical hardware resources. Virtualization enables quick deployment of computer systems, a way to quickly restore systems to a previously known good state, and the ability to migrate systems between physical hosts.

[VirtManager](https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager) is a graphical tool for managing virtual machines via libvirt. Most usage is with QEMU/KVM virtual machines, but Xen and libvirt LXC containers are well supported. Common operations for any libvirt driver should work.

[Xen](https://github.com/xen-project/xen) is focused on advancing virtualization in a number of different commercial and open source applications, including server virtualization, Infrastructure as a Services (IaaS), desktop virtualization, security applications, embedded and hardware appliances, and automotive/aviation.

[Ganeti](https://github.com/ganeti/ganeti) is a virtual machine cluster management tool built on top of existing virtualization technologies such as Xen or KVM and other open source software. Once installed, the tool assumes management of the virtual instances (Xen DomU).

[Packer](https://www.packer.io/) is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly performant, creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel. Packer does not replace configuration management like Chef or Puppet. In fact, when building images, Packer is able to use tools like Chef or Puppet to install software onto the image.

[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past. It provides easy to configure, reproducible, and portable work environments built on top of industry-standard technology and controlled by a single consistent workflow to help maximize the productivity and flexibility of you and your team.

[VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) is a hosted hypervisor that runs on x64 versions of Windows and Linux operating systems; it enables users to set up virtual machines on a single physical machine, and use them simultaneously along with the actual machine.

# SQL/NoSQL Learning Resources

[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in relational databases.

[NoSQL](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/sql-vs-nosql) is a database that is interchangeably referred to as "nonrelational, or "non-SQL" to highlight that the database can handle huge volumes of rapidly changing, unstructured data in different ways than a relational (SQL-based) database with rows and tables.
